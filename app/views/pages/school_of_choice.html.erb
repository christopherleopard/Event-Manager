                    Indeed, there is a bright future for Whitmore Lake Public Schools as we continue to adapt our
                    academic environments to the rapidly changing world we live in. One of the most exciting
                    factors of our success is the unique body of students enrolled in our public schools. Being a
                    School of Choice district, we're happy to uphold an inclusive environment where students from
                    all backgrounds are welcome to join us in a successful academic journey. Each day, we look
                    forward to welcoming our students into environments that promote learning, friendship,
                    motivation, and many more character building aspects that we've worked hard to create in each of our public schools.
