                Whitmore Lake Public Schools is an exceptional learning institute that works towards high
                achievement and individuality in a community environment. Being on the smaller side, our staff
                gets to know each student personally, allowing them to tailor teaching styles to students and
                provide opportunities to help them excel. Your student will never be at a Whitmore Lake Public
                School where the staff doesn't know their name. The staff really cares about their students'
                achievement, safety, and education, meaning they will work hard to make their success happen.
