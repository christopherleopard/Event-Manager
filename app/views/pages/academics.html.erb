                    At Whitmore Lake Public Schools, the well being of our students is our #1 priority, and their
                    success is extremely important to us. We're proud of our small population culture, which allows
                    us to get to know each student personally. This means that we can offer exactly what that
                    student needs to succeed. While core classes are important at both the elementary and high
                    school level, we believe our unique elective classes are just as important in helping to
                    personalize the education experience. Facilitating student growth while accommodating
                    personal interests into each individual's education is what we excel in at Whitmore Lake Public
                    Schools! Our smaller size and inclusive culture fosters a sense of belonging and school pride

                <p>
                    Whitmore Lake Elementary offers our students a unique education experience through
                    personalized teaching and mentoring. Less than 500 students are enrolled in our Elementary
                    School, which allows our teachers to understand the unique needs and interests of each student
                    in order to customize the education experience. Even at the elementary level, we help facilitate
                    academic success by encouraging engagement in more challenging educational arenas and by
                    supplementing core class requirements with the flexibility of individual learning plans,
                    regardless or age or grade.

                    Whitmore Lake Middle & High School offers a personalized secondary education, and an
                    inclusive environment to ensure students are prepared for both their high school and post-
                    secondary school journey. We encourage our students to take advantage our unique offerings
                    and advanced placement opportunities in order to prepare themselves for the next level of
                    education. It is refreshing to see that Whitmore Lake Middle & High School students are
                    unengaged in the stereotypical cliques that have become all too common in many schools. We
                    attribute this positive feature of our school district to the small class sizes that create an
                    inclusive culture among the students and faculty. It is qualities like these that truly help
                    Whitmore Lake High School foster a culture of college readiness.
