            <p>If you answered yes to these questions, then there are some great opportunities for you at Whitmore Lake Community Recreation! The success of our programs hinges on the time our dedicated volunteers give. There are a variety of ways you can get involved and volunteer: office work, coaching soccer, participating in our spring clean ups, the list goes on and on! Volunteers will be recognized at the annual WLPS volunteer reception. In our dedication to providing the safest environments for our participants, we require background checks on all our volunteers. We have joined forces with the National Recreation and Park Association's Operation TLC2 Making Communities Safe and screen all of our volunteers through their recommended NCSI program.</p>
