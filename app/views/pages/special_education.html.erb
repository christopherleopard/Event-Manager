                <p>The Department of Special Education at Whitmore Lake Public Schools strives to educate students in the most inclusive environment possible for each child, with ages ranging from birth to 26 years old. We pride ourselves in strong connections with families and carry our small community's values into the classroom where every child's unique strengths are honored. In addition to teaching the state curriculum, we help each child develop important life skills and encourage academic growth at their own rate. The Department of Special Education at WLPS also participates in mandated Child Find programs and provides services to non-public schools within our district. Overall, we're a family who respects differences, encourages growth, and celebrates one another.</p>
